# double_ext
Double extension for sourcemod


For my extension, I was hesitating to choose between double or multiprecision library (GMP for example).
I did took double for performance, and easier to implement.
Though, GMP could be used into another extension I will maybe make in the future, to implement encryption schemes etc..
